		Question 1
##########################################

input String
output shortened String
_______________________________________________
strOut = ""
count = 1
char = first letter of the input

for characters in the input string starting at i=1 
	if the char is equal to character at the index
		increment count
	else
		temp = current character of the loops index
		if count equals 1
			add the letter to strOut
		else
			add the letter to strOut and the count digit next to it
			reset count to 1
return strOut
______________________________________________

a)	the time complexity of this alogorithm is O(n) since we have to 
	go through the string of length n to build the new one

b)	the space complexity of this alogrithm is also O(n) since we are
	building an new string that depends on the inputed string
	that string is at max size n if each consecutive char is different or
	if the string has a pattern of two letters being the same ei. "aabbccdd"
	since the second character will be substituded by a digit

		Question 2
##########################################

(i)

input array of integers
No output print statement in method instead
__________________________________________________					

smallest = |element 0 - element 1| of the array
largest = smallest
Smallest index = 0
largest index = 0

for element starting at element 1 of the array to the before last element
	if |element i - element(i+1)| is smaller than the value of smallest
		set smallest to |element i - element(i + 1)|
		set Smallest index to the current index
	if |element i - element(i+1)| is larger than the value of largest
		set largest to |element i - element(i+1)|
 		set largest index to the current index

print	index for Smallest index and Smallest index + 1 as well as there values in the array
	and cleary state the this gives the smallest difference	
		

print	index for largest index and largest index + 1 as well as there values in the array
	and cleary state the this gives the largest difference

(ii) 	I wanted to solve this problem in the fastest way possible. knowing that i would somehow
	have to check every element a for loop alows for that.

(iii)	the time complexity of this solution is O(n) since we are doing a for loop over the array
	given the rest is all based on the information that the loop provides.

(iv)	The space complexity of this algorithm is O(1) since all we have is 4 integer values that
	are updated by the calculations.
